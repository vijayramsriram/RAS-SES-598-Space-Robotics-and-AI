## Overview
This assignment challenges students to tune and analyze an LQR controller for a cart-pole system subject to earthquake disturbances. The goal is to maintain the pole's stability while keeping the cart within its physical constraints under external perturbations. The earthquake force generator in this assignment introduces students to simulating and controlling systems under seismic disturbances, which connects to the Virtual Shake Robot covered later in the course. The skills developed here in handling dynamic disturbances and maintaining system stability will be useful for optimal control of space robots, such as Lunar landers or orbital debris removal robots.

## System Description
The assignment is based on the problem formalism here: https://underactuated.mit.edu/acrobot.html#cart_pole
### Physical Setup
- Inverted pendulum mounted on a cart
- Cart traversal range: ±2.5m (total range: 5m)
- Pole length: 1m
- Cart mass: 1.0 kg
- Pole mass: 1.0 kg

### Disturbance Generator
The system includes an earthquake force generator that introduces external disturbances:
- Generates continuous, earthquake-like forces using superposition of sine waves
- Base amplitude: 15.0N (default setting)
- Frequency range: 0.5-4.0 Hz (default setting)
- Random variations in amplitude and phase
- Additional Gaussian noise

## Assignment Objectives

### Core Requirements
1. Analyze and tune the provided LQR controller to:
   - Maintain the pendulum in an upright position
   - Keep the cart within its ±2.5m physical limits
   - Achieve stable operation under earthquake disturbances
2. Document your LQR tuning approach:
   - Analysis of the existing Q and R matrices
   - Justification for any tuning changes made
   - Analysis of performance trade-offs
   - Experimental results and observations
3. Analyze system performance:
   - Duration of stable operation
   - Maximum cart displacement
   - Pendulum angle deviation
   - Control effort analysis

### Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of LQR control parameters and their effects
- Experience with competing control objectives
- Analysis of system behavior under disturbances
- Practical experience with ROS2 and Gazebo simulation

### Extra Credit Options
Students can implement reinforcement learning for extra credit (up to 30 points):

1. Reinforcement Learning Implementation:
   - Implement a basic DQN (Deep Q-Network) controller
   - Train the agent to stabilize the pendulum
   - Compare performance with the LQR controller
   - Document training process and results
   - Create training progress visualizations
   - Analyze and compare performance with LQR

## Implementation

### Controller Description
The package includes a complete LQR controller implementation (`lqr_controller.py`) with the following features:
- State feedback control
- Configurable Q and R matrices
- Real-time force command generation
- State estimation and processing

Current default parameters:
```python
# State cost matrix Q (default values)
Q = np.diag([1.0, 1.0, 10.0, 10.0])  # [x, x_dot, theta, theta_dot]

# Control cost R (default value)
R = np.array([[0.1]])  # Control effort cost
```

### Earthquake Disturbance
The earthquake generator (`earthquake_force_generator.py`) provides realistic disturbances:
- Configurable through ROS2 parameters
- Default settings:
  ```python
  parameters=[{
      'base_amplitude': 15.0,    # Strong force amplitude (N)
      'frequency_range': [0.5, 4.0],  # Wide frequency range (Hz)
      'update_rate': 50.0  # Update rate (Hz)
  }]
  ```

```bash
# Navigate to your local copy of the repository
cd ~/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI

# Add the original repository as upstream (if not already done)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/DREAMS-lab/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI.git

# Fetch the latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Checkout your main branch
git checkout main

# Merge upstream changes
git merge upstream/main

# Push the updates to your fork
git push origin main
```

#### If you don't have a fork yet:
1. Fork the course repository:
   - Visit: https://github.com/DREAMS-lab/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI
   - Click "Fork" in the top-right corner
   - Select your GitHub account as the destination

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI.git
```

### Create Symlink to ROS2 Workspace
```bash
# Create symlink in your ROS2 workspace
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
ln -s ~/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI/assignments/cart_pole_optimal_control .
```

### Building and Running
```bash
# Build the package
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select cart_pole_optimal_control --symlink-install

# Source the workspace
source install/setup.bash

# Launch the simulation with visualization
ros2 launch cart_pole_optimal_control cart_pole_rviz.launch.py
```

This will start:
- Gazebo simulation (headless mode)
- RViz visualization showing:
  * Cart-pole system
  * Force arrows (control and disturbance forces)
  * TF frames for system state
- LQR controller
- Earthquake force generator
- Force visualizer

### Visualization Features
The RViz view provides a side perspective of the cart-pole system with:

#### Force Arrows
Two types of forces are visualized:
1. Control Forces (at cart level):
   - Red arrows: Positive control force (right)
   - Blue arrows: Negative control force (left)

2. Earthquake Disturbances (above cart):
   - Orange arrows: Positive disturbance (right)
   - Purple arrows: Negative disturbance (left)

Arrow lengths are proportional to force magnitudes.
