# Assignment 3: Rocky Times Challenge - Search, Map, & Analyze

This ROS2 package implements an autonomous drone system for geological feature detection, mapping, and analysis using an RGBD camera and PX4 SITL simulation.

## Challenge Overview

Students will develop a controller for a PX4-powered drone to efficiently search, map, and analyze cylindrical rock formations in an unknown environment. The drone must identify two rock formations (10m and 7m tall cylinders), estimate their dimensions, and successfully land on top of the taller cylinder.

### Mission Objectives
1. Search and locate all cylindrical rock formations
2. Map and analyze rock dimensions:
   - Estimate height and diameter of each cylinder
   - Determine positions in the world frame
3. Land safely on top of the taller cylinder
4. Complete mission while logging time and energy performance.

### Evaluation Criteria (100 points)

The assignment will be evaluated based on:
- Total time taken to complete the mission
- Total energy units consumed during operation
- Accuracy of cylinder dimension estimates
- Landing precision on the taller cylinder
- Performance across multiple trials (10 known + 5 unknown scenes)

### Key Requirements

- Autonomous takeoff and search strategy implementation
- Real-time cylinder detection and dimension estimation
- Energy-conscious path planning
- Safe and precise landing on the target cylinder
- Robust performance across different scenarios

## Prerequisites

- ROS2 Humble
- PX4 SITL Simulator
- RTAB-Map ROS2 package
- OpenCV
- Python 3.8+

## Repository Setup

### If you already have a fork of the course repository:

```bash
# Navigate to your local copy of the repository
cd ~/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI

# Add the original repository as upstream (if not already done)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/DREAMS-lab/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI.git

# Fetch the latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Checkout your main branch
git checkout main

# Merge upstream changes
git merge upstream/main

# Push the updates to your fork
git push origin main
```

### If you don't have a fork yet:

1. Fork the course repository:
   - Visit: https://github.com/DREAMS-lab/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI
   - Click "Fork" in the top-right corner
   - Select your GitHub account as the destination

2. Clone your fork:
```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI.git
```

### Create Symlink to ROS2 Workspace

```bash
# Create symlink in your ROS2 workspace
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
ln -s ~/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI/assignments/terrain_mapping_drone_control .
```

### Copy PX4 Model Files

Before building the package, you need to copy the required PX4 model files:

```bash
# Navigate to the package
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/terrain_mapping_drone_control

# Make the setup script executable
chmod +x scripts/setup_px4_model.sh

# Run the setup script to copy model files
./scripts/setup_px4_model.sh
```

## Building and Running

```bash
# Build the package
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select terrain_mapping_drone_control --symlink-install

# Source the workspace
source install/setup.bash

# Launch the simulation with visualization
ros2 launch terrain_mapping_drone_control cylinder_landing.launch.py

```
## Extra credit -- 3D reconstruction (50 points)
Use RTAB-Map or a SLAM ecosystem of your choice to map both rocks, and export the world as a mesh file, and upload to your repo. Use git large file system (LFS) if needed.
